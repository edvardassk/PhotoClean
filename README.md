# PhotoClean
Building AI course project

## Summary

Photo gallery in mobile phone quickly gets mix of everything: good and valuable photos of the family, travels, as well as "one day" photos like photos of clothes before making decision to buy them, prices of interesting item from shop, short term advertisments (e. g. to concert) and alike, which become not needed after a week, if not on the same day. To get rid of these not needed photos take determination: to go through and mark each to delete. Time consuming and uneffective. 
Idea: to label photos for deletion accoding to individual habints of mobile owner


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

Mobile phone photo galery cleaning from unneded photos is:
* time consuming
* repetitous 
* boring

If not cleaned it
*makes difficult to find actual, needed photos
*consumes phones memory intensivelly and I am asked from time to time clean photos

Up to now no of mobile preinstalled software offered me solution for this manual job. In Google Play also nothing interesting. 

Quite common to see people saying that they have to clean photos as mphones memory runs out


## How is it used?

PhotoClean runs on mobile phone.
*Regularly (a. g. monthly, weeekly, other metric, according to user set ups) PhotoClean runs through photo galery and labels photos: "delete" and "not delete"
*list is showed to the mobile phone user as proposal for deletion of photos
*User can change the list either unmarking photos which are lableled "delete" by PhotoClean or adding others into deletion list
*User sends final deletion list to recycle bid
*PhotoClean analyses deletion preferences to improve for the next time
*After period set by user, process runs again

No code, as still in begginer level of courses




## Data sources and AI methods

Data naturally, is already in mobile phone photo gallery. 
ML is neede to analyse photos, which client prefers to delete. First analysis could be done ater notification to client to mark certain numbers of photos clients would like to delete. 
PhotoClean could be pretrained even before upload to recognize common patterns of photos to be labeled as deleted, but initial accuracy wiould be very low, as photo use is very 
subjective and could be many clients segments with differnet photo taking and photos use styles. However ML should be able to adapt to individual client preferences with a time.
