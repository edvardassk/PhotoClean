# PhotoClean
Building AI course project

## Summary

Photo gallery in mobile phone quickly gets mix of everything: good and valuable photos of the family, travels, as well as "one day" photos like photos of clothes before making decision to buy them, prices of interesting item from shop, short term advertisments (e. g. to concert) and alike, which become not needed after a week, if not on the same day. To get rid of these not needed photos take determination: to go through and mark each to delete. Time consuming and uneffective. 
Idea: to label photos for deletion accoding to individual habints of mobile owner


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

Mobile phone photo galery cleaning from unneded photos is:
* time consuming
* repetitous 
* boring

If not cleaned it
*makes difficult to find actual, needed photos
*consumes phones memory resources intensivelly




## How is it used?

Regularly (a. g. monthly, weeekly, other metric, according to user wishes) mobile produces list of photos, which are prosod to be deleted. User can approve, remove from delete list or add addtional ones. Changes are very much welcomme, as they allow to train solution. 
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
